## Project Topic

The topic of my project will be the *Mortality Fluctuation 2015 - 2022*.

I plan to compare COVID-19 with non-COVID years and also different countries with
each other.

Mortality changes during the year, with usually higher rates in winter. During
the pandemic, certain groups claimed the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was no
greater than that, of the 2017 influenza epidemic in Europe.

Hopefully I can visualize mortality changes over year and provide some figures
that allow to compare different years or countries.


## Data Sources

The project will be based on the following data:

* [Short-Term Mortality Fluctuations (STMF)](https://www.mortality.org/Data/STMF)
  data set available at [www.mortality.org](https://www.mortality.org). STMF is
  an international database providing open-access harmonized, uniform, and fully
  documented data on weekly all-cause mortality. Downloaded on 23-Jul-2022.


## Description of the Data

Heare are some specifics about the STMF data:

* WHAT: weekly mortality numbers (deaths per week).
* WHO: reported by 38 different countries (mostly european, but also some non-european).
* WHEN: time span between 2015 to midth of 2022 (for some countries there is
  even data available since 2000; few did only report numbers until end of 2020).
* SIZE: the original dataset has 113,481 rows and 19 columns.
* The data also differentiates:
  * age groups (< 14y, 15-65y, 65-85y, >85y)
  * sex (male, female, both)
  * absolute from relative numbers (relative to population)


## Ideas about the figures to visualize STMF data:

The following visualizations are planned:

* line graphs of weekly mortality
  * for different countries
  * for different years
* bar charts of mortality
  * for different age group
* box plots of mortality
  * for different age groups
  
I also plan to put line graphs side-by-side for easy comparison of:

* one country's mortality with another one's
* one year's mortality with another's (e.g. pandemic with pre-pandemic)
