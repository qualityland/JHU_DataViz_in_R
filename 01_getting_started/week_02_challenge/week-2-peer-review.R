#Week 2 Practice Code

#### If you have not installed the tidyverse yet, run the line below. 
#install.packages("tidyverse")

library(tidyverse)

# RUN THIS CODE WITHOUT MODIFICATION 
# This will import the survey data we have been working with in this course and
# drop data with missing rows from the data
dat <- drop_na(read_csv(url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/uhfstf6g36ghxwp/cces_sample_coursera.csv?raw=1")))



# Problem 1

# The object "dat" created in the assignment code will import the survey data
# for the assignment using read_csv, thereby creating a tibble. Using that
# object as your data, use select() to create a new tibble that include only
# the columns for educational level, whether the respondent has an
# educational loan, employment status, and Trump approval. Display that object.
# Hint: consult the codebook to identify the correct column names.

#### Write your code below:
(new_dat <- dat %>%
    select(educ, edloan, employ, CC18_308a))



# Problem 2

# Continuing to use the new data table you created in Problem 1, use recode()
# to create a new column named "trump_approve_disapprove" that recodes the
# column for President Trump's job approval. A value of "1" should mean that
# the respondent either "strongly" or "somewhat" approves of the President, and
# a value of 0 should mean that the respondent either "strongly" or "somewhat"
# DISapproves of the president. Display the resulting object. 

#### Write your code below:
new_column <-
  recode(
    new_dat$CC18_308a,
    `1` = 1,
    `2` = 1,
    `3` = 0,
    `4` = 0
  )
new_dat$trump_approve_disapprove <- new_column
new_dat



# Problem 3

# Use summarise() to create a summary table for survey respondents who are
# employed full time and are married. The table should have the mean and median
# for the importance of religion column.


#### Write your code below:
dat %>%
  filter(employ == 1, marstat == 1) %>%
  summarize(
    "Mean Importance of Religion" = mean(pew_religimp),
    "Median Importance of Religion" = median(pew_religimp)
  )
